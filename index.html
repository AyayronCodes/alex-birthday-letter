        I got you this Needles long sleeve t-shirt. had a pretty sweet deal on it. Wanted to get you the track pants but couldn't find a good one for right size & price ðŸ˜•. It's overfit so it should fit you no matter how massive you get in goondae. Think you'll like it.

        <strong>Anyways,<br>happy birthday<br>to my BBF!</strong>
        Hope you have a good one. Always remember, "control what you can control". Goondae is pretty darn restrictive but there are still things you can do to stay fun/improve yourself. That ilbyeong to sangbyeong period can be a real pain in the ass... and many other body parts as well, but I know you can get through it! YAY! Rest well today and I hope to see you soon.
